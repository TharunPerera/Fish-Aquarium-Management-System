# Fish-Aquarium-Management-System

"In this system, there are two GUI interfaces: one for internal fish inventory management and the other for customer-side fish ordering. Both interfaces are developed using Java Swing and utilize data structures and algorithms.

The fish inventory management UI offers functions such as adding, deleting, and updating fish entries, all of which are reflected in a JTable. Additionally, the UI provides sorting capabilities for fish species name, fish size, and fish price, allowing users to arrange entries from minimum to maximum or vice versa.

On the customer-side fish ordering interface, users can purchase fish of their choice and the system calculates the total cost, subtotal, and tax based on the fish order. Additionally, there is a button labeled 'Order History,' which, when clicked, displays a separate GUI called 'Order History.' This GUI contains a JTable that showcases automatically generated purchase IDs, order IDs, and total costs.

For the internal fish inventory management, a singly linked list data structure is employed along with merge sort algorithm for efficient sorting. Meanwhile, for managing order history in a FIFO (First In, First Out) concept, a circular queue data structure is utilized."
